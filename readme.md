###  Weekend 2 Assignment
##  Tic Tac Toe Game

# Explorer Mode
 The script should play a game of tic-tac-toe to a win or draw, and then print the game's result.
 A draw occurs when their are no moves left on the board and there are no winners.
 Each turn, the user specifies their input by entering a number, and the program prints out a display of the resulting board.
 If the player chooses a number that is not inside the board then their input doesn't count and they need to pick again.
 The player chooses a random open square.
# Adventurer Mode
 Include a 2-player mode where player 2 is also a human.
 If the player chooses a square that is already taken then their input doesn't count and they need to pick again.
# Epic Mode
 Add better AI (hardcoding "if the board is this, play this" is tractable, but there are other approaches, depending on how nightmarish you want to go).
